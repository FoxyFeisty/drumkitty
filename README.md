# drumkitty
--- work in progress ---

## WHAT IT IS
- An online drum kit designed with JavaScript.
- Playing the sounds works with keys and mouse clicks.
- Files can be recorded and played again.

## WHAT IT WILL BECOME (SOMEDAY)
- A fun app that makes it possible to play a tune, save it locally in the Browser and replay it on the page.
- Users can send a melody to others via mail. The recipient gets a link to the page and can listen to it there (maybe with a message from the user).
- Because everything is better with cats, drum sounds will be replaced with a musical scale made of "meows".
